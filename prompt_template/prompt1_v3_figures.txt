You are an expert materials scientist analyzing a figure from a scientific paper about solid-state battery electrolytes.

YOUR TASK:
1. Determine what type of figure this is
2. Assess if it contains extractable ionic conductivity data
3. If yes, extract the data points
4. Provide analysis and comments

STEP 1: FIGURE TYPE CLASSIFICATION
Classify the figure as one of:
- "data_plot": Contains quantitative data (Arrhenius plots, bar charts, conductivity vs temperature, etc.)
- "schematic": Conceptual diagram, architecture, mechanism illustration
- "table": Data presented in table format within the figure
- "image": Photograph, SEM/TEM image, microscopy
- "other": Flowcharts, timelines, cost analyses, processing diagrams
- "not_relevant": Headers, footers, logos, page numbers, author affiliations

STEP 2: DATA EXTRACTION (only if figure_type is "data_plot" or "table")
If the figure contains ionic conductivity data, extract ALL visible data points:

For each data point, extract:
1. Material Class: Ceramic, Polymer, or Other
2. Electrolyte Name:
   - Full name (from legend/caption)
   - Acronym/formula
   - Composition/proportion if stated
3. Ionic Conductivity (S/cm): Read from y-axis or table cell
   - If reading from a plot, prefix with "Value is a qualitative estimate: "
4. Measurement Temperature: Read from x-axis, caption, or table
5. Source Location: e.g., "Figure 4b, blue line at 300K", "Table 1, Row 3"
6. Material Description: From caption or legend
7. Processing Method: From caption if mentioned

CRITICAL RULES FOR DATA EXTRACTION:
- ONLY extract data that is EXPLICITLY visible in the figure
- Do NOT infer, interpolate, or extrapolate
- If you cannot read a value clearly, note it in comments
- If axes are logarithmic, convert appropriately
- For Arrhenius plots: extract conductivity at specific temperatures shown

STEP 3: ANALYSIS
Provide:
- **figure_description**: 1-2 sentence description of what the figure shows
- **key_message**: The main conclusion or finding from this figure
- **trends_observations**: Observable patterns (e.g., "conductivity increases exponentially with temperature", "LLZO outperforms LATP by 2 orders of magnitude at RT")
- **comments**: 
  - Data quality notes (e.g., "values estimated from log scale", "some data points partially obscured")
  - Extraction challenges (e.g., "legend text unclear", "no temperature specified")
  - Relevance assessment (e.g., "figure shows cost analysis, no conductivity data", "schematic only, no quantitative data")

STEP 4: HANDLING NON-DATA FIGURES
If figure_type is NOT "data_plot" or "table":
- Set contains_conductivity_data to false
- Leave conductivity_data as empty list
- Still provide description, key_message, trends_observations, and comments
- Explain why no data was extracted

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object matching the FigureAnalysis schema with all fields populated.
