Task: High-Precision, CONTEXT-PRESERVING Data Aggregation (JSON Output)

You are an expert electrochemist. Your task is to aggregate ionic conductivity data 
while PRESERVING critical distinctions that affect material performance.

## CRITICAL RULE: Do NOT Over-Aggregate
- A "group" should represent materials that are ACTUALLY comparable
- Pellets and thin films are DIFFERENT groups (even if same chemistry)
- Different processing methods that yield >1 order of magnitude difference = separate groups

## Grouping Strategy (Multi-Level):

### Primary Grouping: Crystal Family + Form Factor
Format: "{Crystal Family}-{Form Factor}"

Examples:
- "Garnet-type Pellet"
- "Garnet-type Thin Film" 
- "NASICON-type Pellet"
- "PEO-based Polymer"
- "Other (Composite)"

### Sub-grouping Rules:
Within each primary group, distinguish by:
1. **Processing method** if conductivity differs by >1 order of magnitude
2. **Composition** if significantly different (e.g., LLZO vs Al-doped LLZO)
3. **Phase** (amorphous vs crystalline)

Example - LLZO should become MULTIPLE groups:
- "Garnet-type LLZO Pellet (Sintered)"
- "Garnet-type LLZO Thin Film (PLD)"
- "Garnet-type LLZO Thin Film (Sol-gel)"
- "Garnet-type LLZO Thin Film (Amorphous)"

## Temperature Handling:
- Do NOT mix RT and high-temp measurements in same range
- If data spans multiple temps, note: "25°C (RT)" vs "80°C" separately
- Format: "25°C" or "25-80°C range" (never use non-ASCII degree symbols)

## Conductivity Range Rules:
- If range >2 orders of magnitude, check if you over-aggregated
- Include representative values: "1.0×10⁻³ S/cm (best), range: 10⁻⁴-10⁻³"
- Note outliers: "Typical: 10⁻⁵, one report of 10⁻⁸ (anomalous)"

## Processing Method Linkage:
CRITICAL: Link processing to performance
Format: "[Method]: [Conductivity achieved]"

Example:
"Sol-gel + field-assisted sintering: 1.0×10⁻³ S/cm (highest); 
 Standard solid-state: 7×10⁻⁴ S/cm; 
 Aerosol deposition: 1.1-2.7×10⁻⁶ S/cm (lower)"

## Material Description Must Include:
1. Form factor (pellet/film/tape)
2. Phase (crystalline/amorphous)
3. Key distinguishing feature (grain size, thickness, doping)
4. Performance ranking if multiple entries

Example:
"Cubic phase LLZO pellets, sintered at 1100°C, grain size 5-10 μm. 
 Highest reported RT conductivity for LLZO (~10⁻³ S/cm)"

## Output Schema Clarification:

grouping_key: Use format "{Family}-{Form}-{Method}" if needed for distinction
Example: "Garnet-LLZO-Film-PLD" vs "Garnet-LLZO-Film-Solgel"

consolidated_processing_method: 
Link each method to its achieved conductivity
Use format: "[Method A]: [Conductivity A]; [Method B]: [Conductivity B]"
